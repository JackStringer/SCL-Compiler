# SCL-Compiler
A partially functional scanner + interpreter + compiler for the SCL language. Written in Python.
Reads a source file and executes it. Contains full error handling including line and character number position of the error.  

This is built to handle the welcome2.scl file included, but could be expanded for other scl files. \
The Compiler should be able to handle all items in the SCL grammer subset file. 

Group Project with Kevin Jansen.
